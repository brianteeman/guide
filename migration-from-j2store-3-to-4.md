# Migration from J2Store 3 to 4

This article is a guide for those looking to migrate from J2Store 3 to J2Store 4 so that they can upgrade their Joomla version to the latest Joomla 4.



{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**The following instructions apply ONLY IF you have a Joomla 3 website with J2Store 3.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**IMPORTANT: Please carefully read the instructions and try the migration in a staging / development / testing copy of your site. There are a number of breaking changes. If you attempt to migrate directly in a live environment, it may lead to site crashing / fatal errors.**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**So attempt the migration in a testing / staging copy of your site first.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAUTION:**

While we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition, please note that unforeseen circumstances may arise during the migration process. Example: You might have an incompatible plugin, a third-party extension that conflicts with J2Store and so on. &#x20;

Though we'll make every effort to assist, we cannot be held accountable for potential issues that may occur as a result. Proceed with caution.
