# Ordering products on your storefront

Organizing your products is an important factor to increase the user-friendliness of your store. The following article describes how your products could be organized.

## Options available: <a href="#options-available" id="options-available"></a>

Ordering options could be found under Menu manager->Your productâ€™s menu item->Common options-> Article order.

### The following are the options: <a href="#the-following-are-the-options" id="the-following-are-the-options"></a>

**Use global** - This would display the articles in the order as specified on the Joomla Global c configuration(under System->Global configuration->Articles->Shared->Article order). &#x20;

**Featured products(articles) first**- The products that are marked as featured, would be listed first followed by the others.

**Most recent first** - The most recently created products/ articles would be listed first. **Oldest first**- This option would allow the product that are the oldest to be displayed first.&#x20;

**Title alphabetical**- With this option you could sort your products based on their titles in alphabetical order. **Title reverse alphabetical**- This option would sort the products in the reverse alphabetical order.&#x20;

**Author Alphabetical**- The products would be sorted based on their author names alphabetically.  **Author reverse alphabetical**- Products will be ordered based on their author names in reverse alphabetical order.&#x20;

**Most hits**- The products that have received most hits would be listed first. **Least hits**- The products with the least hits would appear first.&#x20;

**Article order**- The order in which they are sorted in the Content->articles part would be the order of the products at the **F**rontend.

**Consider both Category and Article ordering :** This option you could sort your products based on the ordering of the Categories and also the products/articles within the Category either in Ascending or Descending order.&#x20;

**Ordering Direction& Category Ordering Direction:**

&#x20;Choose whether the Product Articles should be ordered alphabetically from A to Z(ascending) or from Z to A(descending).

The value you choose here should be the same as the one chosen under Content->Articles->Sort Table by:

Similarly for the category ordering direction, the value chosen at the menu should match the one chosen at the Content->Categories->Sort table by option.

**For Example :**                                                                                                                                                               Let us consider that you have a Clothing store and there are two Categories one as Men's Clothing with various products such as Belt, Hat, T-Shirt, Shirt, and so on and other as Women's Clothing with products as Tops, Skirts, Jeans, so on.                                                                                                                                       &#x20;

Let us assume that you wish to create a menu which displays all the products of all the above categories in the following category order:

* The products of Men's category should be displayed in ascending order.
* Then the products of Women's category should be listed in ascending order.

Let us learn how this ordering can be achieved.

1\) Go to Menu Manager->YOUR PRODUCT MENU->Common options tab.

2\) Set the article ordering option to **Consider both category and article ordering.**

3\) Set the option Ordering direction to Order ascending in the same tab.

![](../.gitbook/assets/ordering5.png)

7\) Set the option **sort table by** in the right top corner to **Ordering ascending.**

8\) Now at the frontend, all the products should be displayed as per the categories and products in ascending order.
