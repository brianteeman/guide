# How to create options and add them to your products

Who doesnâ€™t prefer choices when they wish to buy their favorite t-shirt ? Obviously, your users would love when the products have additional options. J2Store allows you to create [options of various types](http://docs.j2store.org/catalog/options)

Here is how you could create product options and add them to your products.

## Instance: <a id="instance"></a>

Lets suppose you are trying to sell a customizable t-shirt. So this t-shirt has options called color, size and requests users to fill in the custom text that they will have to print on the t-shirt.

Now that we know the requirements, let us get into the process of setting the options up.

### Creating the options <a id="creating-the-options"></a>

* Navigate to **J2Store-&gt;Catalog-&gt;Options.** Click on the New option.

* Enter the unique name, display or presentation\(in our case, let us create color of the type radio and size of the type checkbox first\).
* Choose the type and set the published status.
* Add option values, images\(they would be displayed only if the option type is radio\) and specify the ordering\(the order in which they would be listed in the product part\).

* Create a text area type option for collecting the text to be displayed on the shirt.
