# Limitations of PayPal Standard with Subscriptions

## Required Subscribers to Have a PayPal Account:

PayPal requires **subscribers to have a PayPal account** for automatic recurring payments. This means that customers will **not** be able to check out without having a PayPal account or by creating one during the checkout process.

## Currency Limitations:

Please make sure that the merchant's currency is one that is supported by PayPal. If your store's currency is not supported by PayPal, then IPN notifications wouldn't reach the store and as a result, order statuses of concerned subscriptions would not be updated automatically

## PayPal Merchant Accounts:

PayPal Standard also limits the PayPal account holder from using the same PayPal account on multiple websites. As a result, **PayPal Standard can only be used to sell subscriptions on one website**.
