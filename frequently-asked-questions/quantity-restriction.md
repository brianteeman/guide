The following article demonstrates how to set up quantity restriction for your products. Many a times you might want to limit the quantity of the products that are bought by the users. Here is how it is done.

**Scenario:**

Lets assume that you wish to sell a Shirt and you want to restrict the minimum quantity to be purchased as 2 and the maximum number of Shirts to be bought as 4.

**Procedure:**

&#x20;Navigate to the productâ€™s article, click on the J2Store cart tab. Click on the Inventory tab. Enable the Quantity restriction option.

When you try to set a global quantity restriction for all of your products, then it is possible by following the below steps:

* Navigate to J2Store->Setup->Configuration->Inventory->Set the Minimum sale quantity and the Maximum sale quantity.
* The above setting could be overridden at the product level if there are any requirements.
